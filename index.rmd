> I am a postdoc in Biostatistics at the [Victorian Centre for Biostatistics](http://www.vicbiostat.org.au), working across [MCRI](https://www.mcri.edu.au/users/margarita-moreno-betancur) and the University of Melbourne. I combine methodological research in survival analysis, missing data and causal inference, with collaborative research in various substantive areas, particularly in [child](https://health.adelaide.edu.au/betterstart/) and [adolescent](https://www.mcri.edu.au/research/themes/population-health/centre-adolescent-health) health. Below you will find a description and resources for selected projects.

#### Survival analysis with multiple causes of death

With colleagues we developed a model for disease-related mortality that acknowledges that death may be caused by several diseases acting together, by considering all diseases mentioned on the death certificate. We thus obtain estimates of burden-of-disease indicators and epidemiological association parameters that better reflect the contribution of certain diseases (e.g. chronic diseases) to mortality.

#### Time-dependent covariates in survival analysis

Time-dependent covariates are typically incoporated in hazard rate models using a Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) approach, i.e. using the last available measurement as the value of the covariate at each event time. With measurement error or missing data this approach is biased, which has led to the development of joint modelling approaches. We developed a two-stage joint modelling approach to handle these issues when dealing with multiple continuous markers (paper under review).

* [R package 'survtd'](https://github.com/moreno-betancur/survtd): Use this R package to apply the usual LOCF approach or our approach to incorporate multiple time-dependent covariates in the Cox and additive hazard models.

#### Measuring socioeconomic inequalities in health

The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII) are two indices used to measure relative and absolute socioeconomic gradients in health. With colleagues we provided formal definitions for these indices and proposed methods for estimation with individual or aggreated time-to-event data.
